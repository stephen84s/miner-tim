## 2026-04-08 - Hot Path Optimization Batch

### Request
Implement miner hot-path optimizations:
1. Replace per-iteration deep-cloned work items with shared `Arc<Job>`.
2. Replace per-iteration blob cloning with per-worker nonce buffer reuse.

### Code Changes
- Updated `PoolConnection.current_job` to `Arc<Mutex<Option<Arc<Job>>>>`.
- Updated `PoolConnection::get_work()` to return `Option<Arc<Job>>`.
- Updated job installation paths (initial login + receiver updates) to store `Arc::new(job)`.
- Reworked `worker_loop` to reuse `job_blob_current` and `job_blob_next` buffers.
- Added in-place nonce writer `write_nonce_le(blob, nonce)` for offsets `39..42`.
- Added malformed-job guard: skip and warn when blob length is `< 43`.

### Files Modified
- `app/src/main/rust/src/pool_connection.rs`
- `app/src/main/rust/src/miner.rs`

### Verification Performed
- `cargo check` (pass)
- `cargo test --release --lib` (pass: 87 passed, 0 failed, 2 ignored)
- Runtime sanity:
  - 4-thread CLI run: connected, dataset initialized, non-zero hashrate observed
  - 12-thread CLI run: connected, dataset initialized, non-zero hashrate observed, shares found

### Notes
- No protocol behavior changes intended; this batch is performance-focused.
- Existing unrelated local working tree changes were preserved.
